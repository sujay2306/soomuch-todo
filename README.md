Live Deployed link can be found here: https://soomuchtodo.netlify.app


A task management / productivity app in React.

With this app you can set up multiple status lanes (backlog, in progress and done) and dynamically add tasks to them. Each task can be given a title and a description and assigned an urgency/priority label. You can also move tasks between the status lanes, edit them, delete them and save them in the browser's localStorage.
